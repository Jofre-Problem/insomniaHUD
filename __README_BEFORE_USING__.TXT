RENAME THE HUD FOLDER TO "insomniaHUD" (without the quotes) IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK PROPERLY!

---

NOTICE:
This HUD contains an executable file that will launch in order to apply user customizations.
If this scares you, as long as you never press the "Customize HUD" button in the main menu, it will never ever run.
To feel better, you can also delete it, and the rest of the HUD exluding customization features will still work flawlessly.
The source code is provided for these executables so you can view them and build them yourself in case you do not trust them.
No, it can't get you VAC'd either, as it doesn't read/write TF2's memory.
