## Info

insomniaHUD is a work-in-progress HUD designed for long play sessions. It is still in very early development, so many elements will be broken or completely unchanged.

## Supported Resolutions

|Resolution|Supported|Comments|
|:--:|:---:|:---|
|16:9|游릭|Works flawlessly with a vertical resolution of **1080p** or above. There is mild visual jank on **720p** and below, but is still completely usable and functional.|
|16:10 / 8:5|游릭|Works flawlessly with a vertical resolution of **1080p** or above. There is mild visual jank on **720p** and below, but is still completely usable and functional.|
|21:9 (Ultrawide)|游릭|Works flawlessly with a vertical resolution of **1080p** or above. There is mild visual jank on **720p** and below, but is still completely usable and functional.|
|4:3|游리|Works as long as the aspect ratio is *actually* **4:3**. Some **4:3** resolutions listed in the options menu are not actually **4:3**. Some elements may appear uglier, but is still fully usable and functional.|
|5:4|游댮|Not supported, and *probably* doesn't work.|

## Customization

All colors within `./customization/custom_colors.res` can and are meant to be customized. The names of the colors are pretty self explanitory, and `AccentMain` controls the main menu color.

(More coming soon...)
